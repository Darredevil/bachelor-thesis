Modern architectures are now enforcing Data Execution Prevention mechanisms which prevent applications or services from executing code from non-executable memory regions. Return oriented programming is a technique that allows the hijacking of an executable even in the presence of such security defenses. Using this technique and building ROP chains by hand can be a tedious and error-prone process. This project aims to provide a fast and intuitive tool to aid in this process and automate it.
